# Vehicle-Detection
I finalized my capstone project with a machine learning. I created an application that identified and detected vehicles using two different algorithms. Utilizing OpenCV python, I compared the efficiency of Background Subtraction MoG2 and Haar Cascade Classifier. Two scripts were ran independently so the user could clearly determine which algorithm performed the best. This project helped solidify concepts surrounding object detection and OpenCV utilities. The scripts can be found on Github.
