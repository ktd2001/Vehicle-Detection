# Vehicle-Detection
To finalize my capstone project with machine learning, I created an application that identified and detected vehicles. 
Utilizing OpenCV python, I compared the efficiency of Background Subtraction MoG2 and Haar Cascade Classifier. Two scripts 
were ran independently so the user could clearly determine which algorithm performed the best. This project helped solidify
concepts surrounding object detection and OpenCV utilities. The scripts can be found on github.
